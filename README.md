- [ ] Add v-on:keyup.enter to the input element
- [ ] Shorthands for v-on

- [ ] v-if and v-else: add a conditional message when the list is empty
- [ ] Add states: **default** and **edition**
  - State **edition** corresponds to when the user is adding/editing a new item: there will be an **input** form to input the item, buttons to **cancel** the edition, to **save the item**, etc.
